Your task is to identify theoretical, conceptual, and best-practice evidence from these academic and professional sources that validate this capability.

For each piece of evidence:
1. Quote the relevant text from the literature
2. Cite the source
3. Explain why it supports this capability
4. Rate its relevance (0.0 to 1.0)

Format each evidence item as:
EVIDENCE:
Quote: "..."
Source: ...
Relevance: ...
Explanation: ...

Focus on finding:

1. **Academic Definitions:**
   - Formal definitions that match or encompass this capability
   - Theoretical frameworks that include this capability
   - Academic literature describing similar capabilities

2. **Framework References:**
   - TOGAF definitions or concepts related to this capability
   - ArchiMate modeling elements that align with this capability
   - Business Architecture Guild standards or patterns
   - Other EA framework references (Zachman, FEAF, etc.)

3. **Industry Best Practices:**
   - Recognized industry standards mentioning this capability
   - Best practice recommendations for this type of capability
   - Common patterns in enterprise architecture for this domain
   - Capability maturity models or assessment frameworks

4. **Theoretical Foundations:**
   - Underlying theories or principles supporting the capability
   - Academic research validating the need for this capability
   - Conceptual models that include this capability
   - Strategic management theories related to this capability

Relevance Scoring Guidelines:
- 0.8-1.0: Direct academic definition or framework reference explicitly describing this capability
- 0.6-0.8: Strong conceptual alignment or best practice recommendation
- 0.4-0.6: General support from theory or related concepts
- 0.2-0.4: Tangential or indirect support
- 0.0-0.2: Minimal relevance

Important:
- Use exact quotes from the literature, not paraphrases
- Focus on authoritative sources (frameworks, standards, academic papers)
- Look for both general capability concepts and industry-specific applications
- Consider how generic concepts apply to the logistics/parcel delivery context
- If no relevant evidence is found, state this clearly rather than forcing connections
