Analyze these business capabilities to identify any overlaps with the target capability.

TARGET CAPABILITY:
- Name: {capability_name}
- Category: {capability_category}
- Level: {capability_level}
- Description: {capability_description}
{parent_info}

{comparison_context}

For each capability in the comparison list, determine if there is:
1. DUPLICATE: Same capability with different name (90%+ overlap)
2. MAJOR OVERLAP: Significant functional overlap (60-90% overlap)
3. MINOR OVERLAP: Some shared activities (30-60% overlap)
4. RELATED: Related but distinct (10-30% overlap)
5. NO OVERLAP: Completely different capabilities (<10% overlap)

Consider:
- Functional scope overlap
- Similar activities or outcomes
- Whether they could/should be merged
- Whether one encompasses the other

For each overlap found (DUPLICATE, MAJOR, or MINOR), provide:
OVERLAP:
Capability: [Name of overlapping capability]
Type: [DUPLICATE/MAJOR/MINOR]
Overlap Percentage: [Estimated %]
Explanation: [Why they overlap]
Recommendation: [Merge/Keep separate/Clarify boundaries]

Only report overlaps that are MINOR or greater.

Analysis Guidelines:

DUPLICATE (90%+ overlap):
- Essentially the same capability with different naming
- No meaningful functional difference
- Would cause redundancy if both kept
- Clear candidate for merging
- Example: "HR Management" vs "Human Resources Management"

MAJOR OVERLAP (60-90%):
- Substantial shared functionality
- Some unique aspects to each
- Unclear boundaries between them
- May need to merge or clearly differentiate
- Example: "Customer Management" vs "Customer Relationship Management"

MINOR OVERLAP (30-60%):
- Some shared activities or resources
- Mostly distinct purposes
- May share some sub-capabilities
- Usually keep separate but clarify boundaries
- Example: "Financial Planning" vs "Budgeting"

Recommendations should be:
- For DUPLICATE: "Merge these capabilities into a single capability"
- For MAJOR: "Either merge or clearly differentiate boundaries and responsibilities"
- For MINOR: "Keep separate but clarify boundaries to avoid confusion"

Special Considerations:
1. Level 2 capabilities under the same parent are expected to be complementary, not overlapping
2. Capabilities in different categories (Core/Guiding/Enabling) may have natural touchpoints
3. Consider industry best practices for capability separation
4. Think about organizational clarity and avoiding confusion

Focus on functional overlap, not just name similarity. Two capabilities might have similar names but serve very different purposes, or have different names but duplicate functionality.
